# **FORMAL LANGUAGES AND FINITE AUTOMATA**

This repository contains materials, projects, and implementations related to the **Formal Languages and Finite Automata** course. The repository explores key concepts such as regular languages, context-free grammars, finite automata, and computational theory.

## **Projects Overview**

### **[01. Regular Grammars & Finite Automata](projects/01-regular-grammars)**

This project demonstrates the equivalence between regular grammars and finite automata. It includes grammar parsing, string generation, automaton construction, and string testing, along with an interactive mode for user-defined string testing.

### **[02. Finite Automata](projects/02-finite-automata)**

This project focuses on finite automata, including parsing automaton definitions, converting NDFA to DFA, generating equivalent regular grammars, and analyzing automaton properties. It also provides an interactive mode for processing automaton definitions and conversions.

### **[03. Lexer & Scanner](projects/03-lexer-scanner)**

This project implements a lexer for tokenizing input strings into meaningful components. It supports tokenization of numbers, operators, and keywords, with features like whitespace handling, file-based testing, and an interactive mode.

### **[04. Regular Expressions & String Generation](projects/04-regular-expressions)**

This project explores regular expressions, including parsing, string generation, and testing. It implements a regex engine capable of handling diverse constructs and provides detailed processing steps for each regex.

### **[05. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)](projects/05-chomsky-normal-form)**

This project implements the conversion of context-free grammars to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). It includes grammar parsing, multi-step CNF conversion, and step-by-step output for debugging and understanding the process.

### **[06. Parser & Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)](projects/06-parser-ast)**

This project focuses on parsing mathematical expressions and constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It includes lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, AST construction, and error handling, with support for interactive input and AST visualization.

## **Technologies Used**
